            <h2>
                Dijkstra’s algorithm
            </h2>
            <p>
                It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.The algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices and a set of unvisited vertices. It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.
            </p>
            <h4>Need for Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Purpose and Use-Cases)</h4>
            <p>
                The need for Dijkstra’s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.
                For example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the Destination .

                A - star( A* ) algorithm
            </h2>
            <p>
                A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until the goal node is reached.
            <br>
                At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes

        <p>
            Bidirectional search replaces single search graph(which is likely to grow exponentially) with two smaller sub graphs – one starting from initial vertex and other starting from goal vertex. The search terminates when two graphs intersect.
            <br>
            Bidirectional search is a graph search algorithm which find smallest path from source to goal vertex. It runs two simultaneous search

        <h2>What is the difference between Dijkstra and Astar algorithm?</h2>
        <p>A* algorithm is just like Dijkstra's algorithm, and the only difference is that A* tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra's just explore all possible ways.</p>
